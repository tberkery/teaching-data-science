# teaching-data-science
A series of modules, notebooks, and assignments for teaching data science, with a particular focus on sports analytics. All data derived from *Baseball Reference* at https://www.baseball-reference.com/ (unless noted otherwise).

The modules are designed to be completed in order of scraping, then data conditioning, and finally joins and visualizations. It will be hard to do the joins/visualizations module without having completed the data conditioning module if new to R. The scraping model can be bypassed without significant implications on the data conditioning or joins/visualizations modules. All modules take the form of knittable RMarkdown notebooks. This repository focuses on teaching R data science fundamentals using baseball analytics to spark the interest.
